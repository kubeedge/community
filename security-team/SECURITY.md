# Security Policy

## Report a vulnerability

Please follow steps listed [here](report-a-vulnerability.md) to report a vulnerability.

## Security release process

The KubeEdge community will strictly handle the reporting vulnerability according to this [procedure](security-release-process.md).

## Mailing lists

- [cncf-kubeedge-security@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-kubeedge-security@lists.cncf.io), is for reporting security concerns to the KubeEdge Security Team, who uses the list to privately discuss security issues and fixes prior to disclosure.

- [cncf-kubeedge-distrib-announce@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-kubeedge-distrib-announce@lists.cncf.io), is for advance private information and vulnerability disclosure. 

More details of group membership is managed [here](security-groups.md).

See the [private-distributors-list](private-distributors-list.md) for information on how KubeEdge distributors or vendors can apply to join this list.

## Supported versions

KubeEdge versions are expressed as x.y.z, where x is the major version, y is the minor version, and z is the patch version, following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) terminology.

The KubeEdge project maintains release branches for the most recent three minor releases. Applicable fixes, including security fixes, may be backported to those three release branches, depending on severity and feasibility.

Our typical patch release cadence is every 3 months. Critical bug fixes may cause a more immediate release outside of the normal cadence. We also aim to not make releases during major holiday periods.

See the [KubeEdge releases page](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/releases) for information on supported versions of KubeEdge.
