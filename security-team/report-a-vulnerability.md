We sincerely request you to keep the vulnerability information confidential and responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities.

To report a vulnerability, please contact the Security Team: [cncf-kubeedge-security@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-kubeedge-security@lists.cncf.io). You can email the Security Team with the security details and the details expected for [KubeEdge bug reports](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md). 

The team will help diagnose the severity of the issue and determine how to address the issue. The reporter(s) can expect a response within 1 business day acknowledging the issue was received. If a response is not received within 1 business day, please reach out to any Security Team member (listed [here](security-groups.md), under the `The Security Team` section) directly to confirm receipt of the issue. Weâ€™ll try to keep you informed about our progress throughout the process.

### When Should I Report a Vulnerability?
