# Definition of Cloud Robot CRD and Operator

## Background

The emergence of cloud-native architecture has further facilitated the development of cloud-native robotics technology. Cloud-native architecture encompasses characteristics such as containerization, microservices, and elastic scalability. These features enable robotic systems to adapt more effectively to complex work environments and diverse task requirements. Leveraging containerization technology for deployment and management, the maintainability, scalability, and flexibility of robot systems are significantly improved.

Despite the widespread application of cloud-native robotics in industries such as industrial automation and logistics and warehousing, there is still a lack of a universal management and control solution that offers high availability and scalability for robots. This significantly hinders the broader adoption of cloud-native robotics and impedes further development in the robotics industry. A comprehensive set of CRDs and Operators is thus needed to enhance the scalability, flexibility, and availability of robots.

This proposal presents a design solution for a universal CRDs and Operator, enabling resource monitoring and automated control of cloud-native robots. 

## Goals

For developers or end users of CRDs and Operators, the goal of this project is to provide the following capabilities

CRDs are defined to achieve

- Defining robot resources
- Extending the robot API to enable robot control

Operator is designed to achieve

- automatizing robotic operations

- System user: As a system user, I want to release a task and the system will automatically assign these tasks to specific robot nodes.
- Robot maintainer: As a robot maintainer, I want the robot to have the ability to handle simple failures, and perform operations such as charging, thereby liberating manpower.

## Design Details

### Architecture

For this project, the architecture adopted basically follows the overall architecture of KubeEdge. The architecture diagram of the project is shown in the figure below:

<img src="./images/architecture.png" alt="architecture" style="zoom:90%;" />

The current predominant approach for managing cloud robots is to treat the robot as a unified entity, considering it as a Device and accessing the KubeEdge platform for management and scheduling purposes.

However, given that a robot is inherently composed of diverse sensors and controllers, it is more appropriate to view it as a combination of heterogeneous components rather than an indivisible arrangement. Consequently, in this solution, a robot is treated as an edge node, with its sensors serving as the device access platform for that node.

The Robot node should apply an agent to parse the command from the cloud and send heartbeat message to cloud.

## CRD design

The purpose of this proposal is to propose a set of universal CRD and Operator for cloud robot. Since most industrial robot companies in China have joined the Mobile Robot Industry Alliance, the data interface specifications for robots and their scheduling systems proposed by them are widely applicable. This proposal refers to this specification to design the robot CRD.

To achieve our goal, we need three kinds of CRDs: **robot CRD**, **task CRD** and **robotSync CRD**. The robot CRD and task CRD describe the robot status and task information respectively, and the robotSync CRD is used to record the registered robots' information. When the key information of the robot changes, the status information will be reported immediately, otherwise the information is reported in the form of a heartbeat frame at a period set by the user. Task resources are created by users and delivered by the Controller.

- The fields contained in the **robot** resource can be described as the table below:

|        Fields       |   Type   |              Description               |
| :-----------------: | :------: | :------------------------------------: |
|       robotID       |   uint   |            Unique ID of a robot        |
|      position       |  struct  | Indicates the location of the robot, including coordinates, the last point passed, etc. |
|   running_status    |  struct  | Represents information related to robot motion, including linear velocity and angular velocity |
|     task_info     |  struct  | Including the identification of orders and tasks, a task can be represented by a series of points and segments |
|    battery_status    |  struct  | Including information such as remaining battery power, charging status, etc. |
|   abnormal_events   | struct[] |         Record the exception information of the node         |
|   sensors   |   struct[]    |   A list of robot sensors   |
|   resource_status   |     struct     |   Including information of CPU, GPU, memory, etc.  |

-  The fields contained in the **task** resource can be described as the table below:

|          Field          |   Type   |                 Description                 |
| :---------------------: | :------: | :-----------------------------------------: |
|         orderID         |   uint   | The unique identification of the order in the system, used to identify whether multiple tasks belong to the same order |
|         taskID          |   uint   | The orderID and taskID jointly identify the task status currently executed by the robot |
|       allocated         |  string  | Empty if not assigned, otherwise the assigned robotID |
|  point_status_sequence  | struct[] |     Sequence of points already received and not executed     |
| segment_status_sequence | struct[] |    Sequence of segment already received and not executed     |
| task_destination_ID  |  uint  | Describe the task destination point ID  |

- The fields contained in the **robotSync** resource can be describe as follow:

|          Field          |   Type   |             Description         |
| :---------------------: | :------: | :-----------------------------: |
|     registed_robots     |  uint[]  |    A list of registered robotID   |
|     last_heartbeat      |   map[string]Time   |    The last time a heartbeat packet was received  |

## Controller design

The Controller is mainly used to monitor the newly added custom resources in the cluster, or the changes of existing resources, and execute corresponding logic based on these information.

For *Task Controller*

1. When a new task resource is created in the cluster, Task Controller should monitor this change
2. The Task Controller assign the task to a node that can execute the task
3. Then the Controller should update the corresponding fields of the robot and task CR

For the *Robot Controller*

1. The Robot Controller monitors the changes of the robot resources
2. According to the changes, the Controller send the corresponding command to the node

For the *Registration Controller*

1. The Registration Controller listen for registration messages and heartbeat from robot nodes, and monitor the status of node at the same time
2. Creating the robot CR if it receives the registration message and maintaining the information of robotSync CR. If the node goes offline, set the DeletionTimeStamp for the corresponding robot CR

The processing logic of each Controller is shown in the figure below:

### Robot Registration

<img src="./images/registration.png" alt="registration" style="zoom:70%;" />

Robot registration process:
1. Once the robot node join in the cluster, it will send heartbeat message to the cloud
2. When receiving the heartbeat, Registration Controller will update the heartbeat information, if the node is not registered it will, on the one hand, create a robot CR, and on the other hand, update the last heartbeat.

Robot offline condition:
1. When the robot fails or is manually shut down, the node will no longer send heartbeat packets.
2. If the Registration Controller finds that the heartbeat packet has not been received for a certain period of time, it will determine that the robot is offline.
3. Remove the corresponding robot ID from the registered list.

### Use case

Take the fleet scheduling system as an example:

![fleet_scheduling](./images/fleet_scheduling.png)

Fleet scheduling can be divided into four stages

1. vehicle registration:
   - When the vehicles join in the cluster, they will send heartbeat message including the necessary vehicle information.
   - After the Registration Controller receives the heartbeat message, it will query the last_heartbeat map, if the key does not exist, it creates a robot CR and updates the information to the robotSync CR. Otherwise, the controller updates the robot CR and robotSync CR.
2. task release:
   - The user creates a task CR on the cloud according to the specific task process
3. task assignment:
   - The Task Controller monitors the creation of the task CR and obtains the task content then selects a suitable robot from the registered robot list in robotSync to assign this task. It also update the necessary fields in the  robot and task CR.
4. task execution:
   - The Robot Controller listens to changes in the fields of the robot CR and obtains task-related information then it sends action messages to the corresponding nodes
