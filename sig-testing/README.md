# Testing Special Interest Group

Interested in how we can most effectively test KubeEdge. We're interested specifically in making it easier for the community to run tests and contribute test results, to ensure KubeEdge is stable across a variety of cluster configurations and cloud providers.

The [charter](https://github.com/kubeedge/community/blob/master/sig-testing/charter.md) defines the scope and governance of the Testing Special Interest Group.
