# KubeEdge Technical Steering Committee Charter

This document outlines the mission, scope, and objectives of the KubeEdge Technical Steering Committee.


## Mission

The KubeEdge Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is the governing body for the KubeEdge project, providing decision-making and oversight pertaining to the KubeEdge project bylaws. The Technical Steering Committee also defines the project values and structure.


## Direct Responsibilities for the the KubeEdge TSC

- Establish and maintain the overall technical governance guidelines for the project.

- Ensure the team adheres to our code of conduct and respects our values.
- Foster an environment for a healthy and happy community of developers and contributors.
- Establish strategic collaborations in building cross-community partnership.
- Define any certification process.
- Make decisions by majority vote if consensus cannot be reached.


## Structure
The Technical Steering Committee consists of 7 individuals. No single Member Company may have more than 1/3 representatives. Members serve 2 year terms.

## Decision
The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) requires a quorum of the members to be present for any type of decision making process. An official TSC decision will be carried through by a majority vote (i.e more than half of the TSC vote yes).

During the first year of the TSC term, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the community, if the TSC meeting does not get a quorum in live attendance, then an email quorum voting procedure will be initiated. If email voting does not get a quorum in a week, then the motion will be treated as approved if there is no outstanding objection from any of the TSC members.


The starting compositions are picked by the [project maintainers](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/blob/v1.11.0/MAINTAINERS.md) based on contributions and experience.

After the initial term of each Technical Steering Committee representative is completed, their seat will be open for any contributor in the community to be elected into the seat via a community vote. Only community members that have made significant contributions during the last 1 year may vote. Contributions include but are not limited to: review, comment, commit or create PR or issue, public talks, blog posts, etc.



### Process for TSC Member Nominations and Election:

Nominations: Each individual in a Selecting Group may nominate up to two (2) people, at most one (1) of whom may be from the same group of Related Companies. Each nominee must agree to participate prior to being added to the nomination list. Self nomination is allowed. Each nominee needs 2 more contributorsâ€™ endorsements from different organizations/companies.

- A nomination requires a maximum one (1) page nomination pitch which should include the nominee's name, contact information and supporting statement identifying the nominee's experience.
Current TSC shall determine the process and timeline for the nominations, qualification and election of new TSC members.
- A minimum of 14 calendar days shall be reserved for an Evaluation Period whereby TSC nominees may be contacted by members of the TSC.
- Nominees should have made significant contributions to the community during the last 1 year.

*Elections*: If the number of Qualified Nominees is equal to or less than the number of TSC seats available to be elected, the Qualified Nominees shall be approved after the nomination period has closed. If there are more Qualified Nominees than open TSC seats available for election, then the Selecting Group shall elect the TSC members via a Condorcet vote. A Condorcet vote shall be run using the Condorcet-IRV method through the Cornell online service (https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/).


If a member of the Technical Steering Committee changes companies, by default they retain and may continue on with the role. If the employment change results in a single Member Company having more than 1/3 representatives, then one of them must resign, and new elections will be held.

The Technical Steering Committee will decide on and publish an election process within 3 months of formalizing this organizational structure. This will cover voting eligibility, eligibility for candidacy, the election process and schedule.

A Technical Steering Committee member can be removed due to [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) violations.
