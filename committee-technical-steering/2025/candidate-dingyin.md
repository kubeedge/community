## What I have done
I am one of the founders and maintainers of the KubeEdge community and have contributed across multiple areas, including feature development, release management, documentation, community building, cross-community collaboration, and outreach.

- I played a key role in KubeEdge’s early growth by shaping its architecture and delivering multiple core features, launching new SIGs to scale community contributions, updating KubeEdge website content and release notes, and ensuring compatibility with upstream Kubernetes through version upgrades.

- I drove KubeEdge’s progression through the CNCF maturity levels, from Sandbox to Incubation and ultimately Graduation, by collaborating with CNCF TSC members and presenting to the CNCF Runtime SIG and Technical Oversight Committee.

- I promoted KubeEdge at major open-source conferences including KubeCon, Open Networking & Edge Summit and OSS Summit through talks, presentations, and community engagement.

- I promoted KubeEdge through collaboration with other OSS communities, including Kubernetes Edge SIG, and initiated the KubeEdge Akraino Blueprint project within the LF Edge community.

## What I'll do

As a member of the KubeEdge Technical Steering Committee, I am dedicated to strengthening the project’s role within the open-source ecosystem. My priorities include promoting broader community engagement, empowering more developers to contribute, and fostering an inclusive, healthy, and innovative community where contributors feel a strong sense of belonging. Looking ahead, I intend to guide the community’s growth into emerging domains such as AI and robotics, while actively engaging with community partners to ensure KubeEdge continues to deliver value and align with their evolving expectations.
