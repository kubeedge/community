## What I have done

I'm the founding member of KubeSphere and the co-author of several cloud native projects such as whizard, Fluent Operator, Kube-Events, Notification Manager etc. I love cloud-native technologies especially observability, edge computing and eBPF-related fields. I have contributed to KubeEdge, KEDA, Prometheus Operator, Thanos, Loki, and Falco. I'm also an active speaker and have spoken at almost every year's KubeCon since 2019.

As the TSC member of KubeEdge and the maintainer of KubeSphere, I've been actively promoting the collaboration of the KubeEdge and KubeSphere communities.

## What I'll do

As the KubeEdge TSC member, I would like to:
- Actively participate in KubeEdge community activities to help the development of the KubeEdge project
- Promote the collaboration of KubeEdge community and other communities
