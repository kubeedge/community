What I have done

Since 2021, I introduced KubeEdge to DaoCloud and then led its Edge & open source team to work on KubeEdge project as well as its product. During past 4 years, I and my team achieved solid contributions:
1. DaoCloud now is 2nd biggest contributor of KubeEdge community, my team played several vital roles (maintainer, approver, owner, etc) in key areas such device/cluster/test/release
2. I personally was TSC member and drove overall direction of KubeEdge for 2 years, and worked with team to successfully get it graduated
3. As DaoCloud COO, I fully leveraged DaoCloud market resource to organize quite a few meetup/events/activities to promote KubeEdge and enhanced its influence
4. I expanded KubeEdge industrial coverage and successfully landed KubeEdge in steel/chemical/satellite/electric power fields
5. I acted as mentor and participated in 10+ mentorship program (LFX, summer ospp) to cultivated tens of open source developers
6. I put efforts on keeping KubeEdge closely connected with other open source organizations like SHOpen/CCF and a few universities

What I'll do

If I have opportunity to continue TSC role, I will try all my ways to help KubeEdge on below areas
1. Work with TSC team on daily project governance and maintain a transparent/vigorous and diversified community
2. Oversee project direction and drive KubeEdge to be more LLM/GAI friendly especially the collaboration between the big and small AI modesl 
3. Continue to lead DaoCloud edge and open source team to focus on KubeEdge tech contribution
4. Keep close connection with industry and try to enable more customers to deploy KubeEdge technology
5. Leverage my resources to promote KubeEdge influence/reputation and expand its developer/end user coverage
